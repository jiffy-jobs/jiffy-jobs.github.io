# About Jiffy Jobs

The Jiffy Jobs web application provides a new way for local and non-local companies who want to recruit students from UH to make their (potential) opportunities known to students. At the same time, students can create profiles on the site with their interests. The site can match students to employers and vice-versa.

* Provide a profile page for companies that includes information about the company and possible job opportunities.
* Provide a profile page for students that includes general information about the student, customization options, and resume/website links.
* Create a dashboard page that lists all companies as cards that includes links to their profile pages & general information.
* Create a search page that allows students to search for opporunities and find company profiles.
* Create an admin profile page to manage what companies appear and filter profiles.
* Feed for company announcements and other important information.
* Implement a rating/point system: Students will have a point display in their profile. Students can earn points through accepting internships. Points are distributed by companies through their profiles. Students will have the option to leave starred reviews for a company.
