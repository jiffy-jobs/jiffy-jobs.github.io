# About Jiffy Jobs

   The UH Manoa students in engineering and computer science are experiencing a major lack of knowledge regarding the jobs or internships that are available and wanting to hire them in or out of college. The only places they can find jobs pertinent to their respective fields is by attending a career fair day or working in one of the limited STEM positions available on campus through the SECE website provided by UH Manoa. The main purpose is to help the engineering and computer science students have more direct line of communication with companies that want to hire them. The students submit their interests which helps match them to employers or vice-versa. The site is built for interactivity between the employers and students to create an engaging and professional environment.
